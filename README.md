# sovereign-network-defense

Open-source cybersecurity detection and defense system for individuals operating on untrusted networks.
Monitors inbound threats, port scans, unauthorized file access, and suspicious processes with real-time alerts, evidence logging, and automatic blocking capabilities.
Why This Exists
Most network security tools are designed for enterprises with IT departments, come with recurring subscription costs, or require trusting closed-source vendors with your security data.
sovereign-network-defense is built on different principles:

No subscriptions - Own it completely
No corporate backdoors - Full source transparency
No cloud dependencies - Runs entirely on your hardware
Evidence-first - Document what's happening to your network
Defense through awareness - Know what's targeting you

Perfect for:

Small business owners on public WiFi
Digital nomads working from cafes and coworking spaces
Consultants handling sensitive client data
Anyone who needs to know what's happening on their network connection

What It Does
Real-Time Monitoring

Detects port scanning attempts
Identifies unauthorized connection attempts
Tracks file access patterns
Monitors process behavior for anomalies

Evidence Collection

Timestamped logs of all security events
Source IP identification and tracking
Attack pattern documentation
Exportable reports for legal/compliance purposes

Automated Response

Configurable blocking rules
Alert notifications (email, SMS, desktop)
Quarantine suspicious activity
Network isolation options

Philosophy
This tool operates on a simple premise: You can't defend what you can't see.
Traditional security operates reactively - after you've been compromised. This approach inverts that model:

Document everything - Create an evidence trail
Understand patterns - Learn what "normal" looks like for your network
Respond intelligently - Make informed decisions, not emotional reactions
Maintain sovereignty - Your data, your hardware, your control

We don't believe in security through obscurity. We believe in security through transparency and ownership.

Why "Sovereign"?
Because true security isn't about trusting someone else to protect you. It's about having the tools and knowledge to protect yourself.
Digital sovereignty means:

Owning your infrastructure
Understanding your threat landscape
Making informed decisions based on evidence
Not depending on corporate or government entities for your security
